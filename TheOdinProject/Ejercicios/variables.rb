#Other Examples, reassinging variables: 

composer = 'Mozart'

#More about variables: 

#You can assign a variable and change their value after in the program
firstValue = 0
firstValue = 2

puts firstValue #=> 2

#But even you can add value with out change the last value: 

firstValue = firstValue + 2
puts firstValue #=> 4

# Or using += operator
firstValue += 4 #=> 8
puts firstValue

# Or using -= operator
firstValue -= 4 #=> 4
puts firstValue

# Or using *= operator
firstValue *= 2 #=> 8
puts firstValue

# Or using /= operator
firstValue /= 2 #=> 4
puts firstValue
